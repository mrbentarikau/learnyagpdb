# Writing a Sorting Algorithm

You have to think about and formulate an algorithm that sorts given data from least to greatest. Specifically, given an unsorted set of N decimal values, your algorithm should sort them to give an answer of the sorted data. You are given dataset of `3.51 1.46 -0.84 -3.53 0.98`  
For this set of N = 6, your algorithm should produce: `-3.53 -0.84 0.98 1.46 3.51 3.92`

After creating the algorithm, test your algorithm and finally generalize it to a CC. Test again. Try with different datasets. Try to reverse from least to greatest to greatest to least.
