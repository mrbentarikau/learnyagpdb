# Division using Addition

There were times when YAGPDB did not have additional template functions for math like `div, mult, sub, etc`, only `add`to deal with all calculations. Addendum to that, no `parseArgs`. 

Your task is to **write a CC "old-school way" which calculates division using inputs** _**dividend**_ **and** _**divisor**_ **of positive, greater than zero integers and its quotient has decimal space of 2 using `add` function.**  First try to think of or search for it from Internet - an algorithm how to divide using addition only, also how to deal with the remainder as decimal space to quotient, then generalize it to code.

For example:  `-div 9973 26` will return `9973 divided by 26 equals 383.57`

Example Solution.
