# Division using Addition

There were times when YAGPDB did not have additional template functions for math like `div`, only `add`to deal with all calculations. Addendum to that, no `parseArgs`. Your task is to **write a CC "old-school way" which calculates division using inputs** _**dividend**_ **and** _**divisor**_ **of positive, greater than zero integers and its quotient has decimal expansion of 2.**  First try to think of or search for it from Internet - an algorithm how to divide using addition only, also how to deal with the remainder as decimal expansion to quotient, then generalize it to code.
