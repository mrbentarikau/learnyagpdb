# Duplicates in a List

You are given a list of numbers having some same repeating digits. Write a CC which will eliminate duplicate entries and return a cleaned list. Present the list to YAGPDB as user input and process it further finding duplicates. The list is as follows: `42 1 2 81 3 5 42 19 2 42 19 81 46`
