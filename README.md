# YAGPDB learning resources

This is your playground!

We are going to teach you how to read code as well as how to write it. After all, how can you **write** if you can't **read?** Learn to read, learn to problem solve, and learn to enjoy the process. The community is there to help, as long as you put in some effort yourself.

So don't worry, **you are doing great!**
