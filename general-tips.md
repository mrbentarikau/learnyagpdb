# General Tips

* New users should start running and learning YAGPDB in a testing environment, not on live-servers; that way you avoid a lot of problems.
* Default state of YAGPDB is all commands running. Before changing any permissions or making command overrides, make yourself welcome with running YAGPDB + custom commands - and only then start limiting permissions and using any overrides, this includes amVs.
* There's no "undo"-button, kicking YAG does not help. Write your changes down at first, then you can revert back manually and actually know what you changed.
* Never assume YAG is running 24/7; don't build your system on that assumption.
*   A cool hardware engineering game called [MHRD ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/576030/MHRD/)has these three introductory steps to follow, it fully applies to CCs as well >&#x20;

    * If you don't know what to do: Read the manual and specifications!&#x20;
    * When creating your design: Draw it out on a piece of paper! No one ever created something great just by looking at their screen...&#x20;
    * If something is wrong with your design: Inspect the error messages and failed tests closely to find where the problem is.

    Keep these in mind... they will come in handy sooner rather than later!
* YAGPDB also has a control panel, not only a dash-board.
* Start simple, never over-complicate things on the first run. This even goes for command triggers.
* Your custom commands will get more lengthy in the future, it's good to get accustomed writing them inside some text-editors or IDEs.
