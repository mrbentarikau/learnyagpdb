# General Tips

* New users should start running and learning YAGPDB in a testing environment, not on live-servers; that way you avoid a lot of problems.
* Default state of YAGPDB is all commands running. Before changing any permissions or making command overrides, make yourself welcome with running YAGPDB and only then start limiting permissions and using any overrides, this includes amVs.
* There's no "undo"-button, kicking YAG does not help. Write your changes down at first, then you can revert back manually and actually know what you changed.
