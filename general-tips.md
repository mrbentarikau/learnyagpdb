# General Tips

* New users should start running and learning YAGPDB in a testing environment, not on live-servers; that way you avoid a lot of problems.
* Default state of YAGPDB is all commands running. Before changing any permissions or making command overrides, make yourself welcome with running YAGPDB + custom commands - and only then start limiting permissions and using any overrides, this includes amVs.
* There's no "undo"-button, kicking YAG does not help. Write your changes down at first, then you can revert back manually and actually know what you changed.
* Never assume YAG is running 24/7; never build your system on that assumption.
* A cool hardware engineering game called [MHRD ](https://www.indiedb.com/games/mhrd)has these three introductory steps to follow, it fully applies to CCs as well &gt; 

  * If you don't know what to do: Read the manual and specifications! 
  * When creating your design: Draw it out on a piece of paper! No one ever created something great just by looking at their screen... 
  * If something is wrong with your design: Inspect the error messages and failed tests closely to find where the problem is.

  Keep these in mind... they will come in handy sooner rather than later!"
